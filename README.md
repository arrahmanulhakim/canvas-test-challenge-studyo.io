# Canvas Test Challenge from Studyo.io

This Flutter project implements a UI with the following features:

## Layout

- **Two Columns**:
  - **Left Column (Source Boxes)**: Contains 4 vertically stacked containers.
  - **Right Column (Destination Boxes)**: Contains 4 vertically stacked containers.
  
## Requirements

- **Containers**: All containers are the same size with consistent spacing.
- **Curves**: A quadratic BÃ©zier curve connects each container in the left column to its corresponding container in the right column.
- **Responsiveness**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining consistent spacing and proportions.
- **Interactivity**: Curves are drawn only after tapping a container in both the left and right columns.
